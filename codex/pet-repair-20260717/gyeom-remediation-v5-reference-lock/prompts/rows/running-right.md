Create one horizontal animation strip for Codex pet `gyeom`, state `running-right`.

Use the attached canonical base for identity. Use the attached layout guide only for slot count, spacing, centering, and padding; do not draw the guide.

Output exactly 8 full-body frames in one left-to-right row on flat pure user-selected #FF00FF. Treat the row as 8 invisible equal-width slots: one centered complete pose per slot, evenly spaced, with no overlap, clipping, empty slots, labels, or borders.

Identity: same pet in every frame: 원본 점토 캐릭터 헤어·얼굴·의상·비율을 고정한 커스텀 펫. Preserve silhouette, face, proportions, markings, palette, material, style, and props.
Style: Pet-safe sprite: compact full-body mascot, readable in a 192x208 cell, clear silhouette, simple face, stable palette/materials, and crisp edges for chroma-key extraction. Style `clay`: Handmade clay or polymer-clay mascot with rounded sculpted forms, soft material texture, simple features, and clean readable edges. User style notes: Deep center-parted black clay hair with thick distinct long wavy strands and asymmetric forehead bangs. Youthful compact toy-avatar proportion. Light gray and black raglan, dark indigo cuffed jeans, charcoal canvas sneakers. No colored halo/fringe..
Animation continuity: keep apparent pet scale and baseline stable within the row unless the state itself intentionally changes vertical position, such as `jumping`. Move the pose within the slot instead of redrawing the pet larger or smaller frame to frame.

State action: Dragging-right loop: show directional movement to the right through body and limb poses only.

State requirements:
- Show directional drag movement to the right through body, limb, and prop movement only.
- The row must unmistakably face and travel right.
- The movement cadence must alternate visibly across the 8 frames instead of repeating one nearly static stride.
- Do not draw speed lines, dust clouds, floor shadows, motion trails, or detached motion effects.

Clean extraction: crisp opaque edges, safe padding, no scenery, text, guide marks, checkerboard, shadows, glows, motion blur, speed lines, dust, detached effects, stray pixels, or chroma-key colors inside the pet.
